            <p>We created ittyurl.me to make the process of sharing links easier. 
                Long, unintelligible web addresses are annoying. 
                No one likes them, but they're not going away.

                While we are excited to provide this service, 
                we also recognize this kind of service is susceptible to abuse.
                To help us maintain a safe, enjoyable service for everyone,
                please review these terms of service.
                <br><br>
                Thank you for helping us keep our service a positive experience for all!

                    <h2>User Agreement</h2><br>
                    <p>For anyone worried about understanding and following our terms of service,
                        I'd like to relieve those fears right now. If you genuinely practice common sense with our services, you should be fine.
                        <br><br>
                        As a general guide, please use our services with these principles in mind:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><h3><strong>Be kind</strong></h3>
                            Don't use our services to create offensive url addresses. <br> 
                            Registered users have the ability to customize urls. This privilege is obviously susceptible to abuse.
                            The owners absolutely <strong>DO NOT</strong> want this service associated with any offensive or demeaning language.
                            Not only are actual people in the world affected by what goes around online, 
                            but also the reputation of ittyurl.me can be damaged by these kinds of abuses. 
                            We reserve the right to restrict or filter urls strings generated by our services. 
                            We also reserve the right to remove or alter, without notice, generated urls we determine violates this rule.  
                        </li>
                        <li><h3><strong>Be considerate</strong></h3>
                            Don't spam, bully, or engage in predatory behavior using our services. <br>
                            The main purpose of shortening urls is to have easily sharable links. How links are shared can be damaging to others and our service.
                            <strong>DO NOT</strong> mass distribute our links to those who are not expecting it, or who do not want it. 
                            This practice can both hurt our reputation and annoy the receivers. <strong>DO NOT</strong> try to mask offensive or malicious sites with our urls
                            to get a third party to unwittingly visit a webpage they might not want to visit. <strong>DO NOT</strong> mask and distribute illegal activity with our urls.
                        </li>
                        <li><h3><strong>Be safe</strong></h3>
                            Please, only shorten urls you are confident are safe to visit. <br>
                            Of course, we don't expect everyone to know the safety of all webpages. We only ask that users keep the safety of others in mind
                            when creating and sharing links.
                        </li>
                        <li><h3><strong>Be honest</strong></h3>
                            Don't disclose or distribute account login information. <br>
                            Registered users will receive privileged services beyond those available to anonymous visitors.
                            Paid users will recieve privileged services beyond those avaiable to basic registered users.
                            We ask that services from accounts only be used by the account owners. <br><br>
                            Using privileged services on behalf of another person is permissible. 
                            Allowing another person to use your account for priviledged services is not permissible.
                            The difference is subtle, but important. The owner is responsible for all uses of our services. Any violations is the owners responsibility,
                            even if the violation was performed by another person. Also, we cannot improve and optimize our services
                            with misleading information about how our services are used.
                        </li>

                    <h2>Terms Violations</h2><br>
                    <p>We acknowledge misunderstandings can happen. We're not all perfect. We will do all we can to minimize unnecessary restrictions.
                        We aim to allow you to use the fullest potential of our services consistent with our policies outlined in these terms of service. <br><br>
                        With that in mind, here is how we intend to handle terms of service violations:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><h3><strong>Offensive Urls</strong></h3>
                            Urls will be screened for offensive language. A url might be flagged by mistake. If a custom url is flagged for language,
                            you can either choose to continue using the url or enter a new url. If you continue using the url, the url will be active and 
                            an administrator will be notified to review the url address. If the administrator determines the url violates terms of service,
                            the url will be deactivated and the user will be notified. We reserve the right to deactivate the user's account for violation of these terms.
                        </li>
                        <li><h3><strong>Harmful Links</strong></h3>
                            If a link is determined to be harmful to visitors, the url will be immediately deactivated. 
                            We reserve the right to deactivate the user's account for violation of these terms.
                        </li>
                        <li><h3><strong>Questionable Sharing Practices</strong></h3>
                            If a link is determined to be shared with spam-like, unsolicited, insensitive practices, we may either deactivate the link
                            or notify the user to comply with terms of service or both.
                            We reserve the right to deactivate the user's account for violation of these terms.
                        </li>
                        <li><h3><strong>Unauthorized Users</strong></h3>
                            For legal and site improvement reasons, accounts must only be used by account owners.
                            We reserve the right to deactivate the user's account for violation of these terms.
